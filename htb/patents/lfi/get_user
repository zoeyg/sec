  <p>Oouch is a simple authorization server based on the Oauth2 protocol. Instead of managing credentials for multiple applications, just create an Oouch 
  account and use it for login on supported applications. Our platform provides maximum comfort and conforms to the highest security standards.</p>
  <p>You have not signed it yet. Please choose between the following options:</p>
  <p>Login at: <a href="/login/">login</a></p>
  <p>Or signup for a new account: <a href="/signup/">register</a></p>
  <p>Notice: For registration we are asking you for SSH credentials to your Oouch orchestration server. This is only required if you want to use the Oouch orchestration
  application. Since this one is currently under development, you want most likely to ignore the SSH related fields inside of the registration form.</p>
