This is an implementation of the Lightweight File Manager LFM Protocol.
It's a pre-fork and pre-thread server, which supports re-forking and re-threading
when the number of child processes of threads goes below a threshold.

It's similar to HTTP, and supports the following methods:

GET /object LFM     [\r\n]
User=user           [\r\n]
Password=password   [\r\n]
                    [\r\n]

CHECK /object LFM   [\r\n]
User=user           [\r\n]
Password=password   [\r\n]
                    [\r\n]
md5_of_the_file     [\r\n]
                    [\r\n]


PUT /object LFM     [\r\n]
User=user           [\r\n]
Password=password   [\r\n] 
                    [\r\n]
bytes_of_the_file   


Communication is based on TCP. 
Default port is 5000.

A configuration file is placed in /etc/lfmserver/lfmserver.conf, where you can
configure thresholds, number of processes, number of threads, ...
